I worked on the Customer Personality Analysis dataset (Kaggle). First, I identified missing values in the Income column and the 24 null values are removed. Duplicate rows were removed. The Marital_Status column was standardized to lowercase and trimmed. The Dt_Customer column was converted to a standard datetime format. Column headers were cleaned by removing spaces and converting to lowercase. Finally, I created a new Age column based on Year_Birth. The cleaned dataset now has 2,240 rows and 28 columns, ready for further analysis.
